 <h1>The Best Movies According to Dora</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all-time!</h2>
 <h />
 
 <h3> Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory </h3>
 <p>This movie makes me wish I could've experienced it in real life. I also love Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Wonka</p>
 
 <h3>Twilight Saga</h3>
 <p>How can I not love these movies? I read all books and watched all movies as they came out. I remember my mom taking me to the midnight showings!</p>

 <h3>The Conjuring movies</h3>
 <p>All are so well made and are actually scary!</p>
