<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Missoula, MT. The town has changed so much in the past 25 years.
However I do not ever want to leave.
</p>

<p>I have one dog named Yuki, and y'all are invited to her birthday. She's a Shiba Inu and has quite the personality.
  She likes to sleep all day and play tug when she's awake. She's not like other dogs either.
  When it comes to breakfast, lunch, or dinner, we never know if she's gonna eat. She'll sit, smell her food, put some in her mouth, and sometimes she'll eat it
  but other times, she'll spit it out. 
</p>

<p>I graduated from The Univeristy of Montana in 2020 with my BS in Business Managment and Information Systems, and did not have a graduation due to Covid.
  I wouldn't have walked anyway though. Now I have a job I've been with for almost two years that I truly enjoy, and a bonus is that I get to work from home most days.
